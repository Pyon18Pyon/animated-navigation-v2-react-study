# animated-navigation-v2-react-study

This project was created in React after the completion of the Udemy course, [JavaSrcipt Web Project: 20 Projects to Build Your Portfolio](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-web-projects-to-build-your-portfolio-resume/)

During this couse, the project was made with vanilla JavaScript so I re-wrote it in React
The vanilla JavaScript version: [animated-navigation-v1-javascript-study](https://github.com/Pyon18Pyon/animated-navigation-v1-javascript-study)
